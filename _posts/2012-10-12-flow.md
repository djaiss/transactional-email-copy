Hi,

Your Flow trial has now expired. But don't worry! We've gone ahead and saved all your work for you. Just hit the button below to activate your Flow subscription and you'll be back up and running in no time.

Activate Flow Now

In the meantime, you can still view and comment on your tasks, but you'll no longer be able to create new ones or take advantage of Flow's other features. Once your subscription is activated, complete functionality will be immediately restored. 

If you have any questions or need a hand setting things up, just reply to this email and we'll be happy to help.

The Flow Team
